I am Paul Godek, third year student in BUT Informatique le Puy-en-Velay's IUT in France. I have been a huge fan of video game for as long as I can remember, and I strive to create games by myself to share my passion to the entire world. 

📝 Studies 📝
After earning my baccalaureate in Mathematics and IT with the honor "très bien", I joined Montpellier's IUT to get a degree in IT (BUT Informatique) which would take three years. Though, after my second year, I decided to be transferred to le Puy-en-Velay's IUT because of its specialty in graphical IT whereas Montpellier's IUT was more focused on web dev. Therefore, I am at le Puy's IUT for my third year !

👥 Social skills 👥
I have always been a social person and very comfortable in teamwork. In my opinion, the most important social skill to have is being able to communicate, which is why I try my best to enable a fluid and comprehensive work environment. I am also very autonomous, and my curiosity always allowed me to learn and comprehend concepts very quickly to accomplish my work efficiently. 

💻️ Technical skills 💻️
I have discovered programming very early in my life with Scratch, and since then, I have been able to learn Java, Python, SQL, PHP/HTML/CSS, and I also have a bit of experience in Unity. My coding is rigorous and precise, to try my best at getting the cleanest and most readable and understandable code as possible, as much for myself than for other programmers.

✨️ Hobbies ✨️
Outside of work, I (of course) am a passionate video game enjoyer, particularly on the Virtual Reality side of things, a technology I find absolutely magical. I have also been a volley-ball player for the past 8 years, and in general a very sportive person.
